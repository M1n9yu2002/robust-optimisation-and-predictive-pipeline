# Robust Optimisation and Predictive Pipeline

Portfolio repository containing two applied statistical projects (SCEM), rewritten with an industry-oriented focus on robustness, decision relevance, and reproducibility.

## 1) Robust Optimisation under Uncertainty (Differential Evolution)
- Compares multiple Differential Evolution (DE) configurations
- Contrasts single-problem selection vs multi-problem blocked design for robustness
- Emphasises stable decision-making over one-off benchmark wins

Files:
- `task01_robust-de-evaluation.Rmd`
- `task01_robust-de-evaluation.html`

## 2) Predictive Modelling Pipeline
- End-to-end workflow: EDA → modelling → validation → holdout evaluation
- Focuses on methodological discipline and reproducible analysis
- Raw course-provided data is intentionally excluded

Files:
- `task02_predictive-pipeline.Rmd`
- `task02_predictive-pipeline.html`

## Notes
- Large / sensitive files (e.g., `.rds`, `.RData`) are excluded via `.gitignore`.

- ## Intended Audience
This repository is intended as a portfolio for:
- Data / Quantitative Analyst roles
- Applied statistics or optimisation-focused MSc / PhD pathways
- Recruiters looking for reproducible, decision-oriented modelling work
